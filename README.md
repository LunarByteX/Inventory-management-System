# Inventory-management-System
Inventory management is basically about making sure you have just the right amount of stuff in stock when you need it. For this project, I built a smart system to handle inventory for places like pharmacies or agriculture stores. It uses a web interface thats pretty straightforward and modern, helping them keep track without all the hassle.

Traditional ways, like writing everything on paper or messing with spreadsheets, get replaced by this dashboard. Its responsive, so it works on different screens, and gives real time views of inventory, plus alerts if something is low. Analytics are there too. The design makes it ready for machine learning later on, for things like predicting demand or optimizing stock better. I think that part is exciting, but its not implemented yet.

The main goals were to make tracking easier for small or medium businesses, cut down on losses from too much stock, running out, or products going bad. And yeah, provide a dashboard thats clean and user friendly, works on mobile or desktop.

Features include user login and registration, picking the business type like pharmacy or agriculture. Then theres a dynamic dashboard showing inventory summaries. Alerts for low or out of stock items, expiry tracking for meds in pharmacies, and stock rotation for farm goods. You can search and filter items too. The whole thing is fully responsive.

On the frontend side, I used ReactJS, Tailwind CSS for styling, HTML5, and JavaScript. Tools were Visual Studio Code for coding, Git and GitHub for version control, and just regular browsers like Chrome or Firefox to test.

Right now, the frontend is done, design and all. Backend stuff, database, and ML integration are planned for later phases. It feels like a solid start, though some parts might need tweaking.

Looking ahead, machine learning for demand forecasting sounds useful, automated recommendations for restocking, integrating with MySQL database, even IoT for real time tracking. And maybe a mobile app eventually. Im not totally sure how the IoT part will work yet, but it seems promising for efficiency.
